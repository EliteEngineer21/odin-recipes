# odin-recipes
This recipe website is my first step in The Odin Project curriculum. Iâ€™ll be starting out by building it with HTML and plan to add CSS later on to improve the design. Through this project, I want to show that I can work with links, images, and lists, while continuing to build on my coding skills and add more features as I go.
