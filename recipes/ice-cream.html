        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>This is a quick and fun way to make homemade ice cream without an ice cream maker.</br>
        All you need are a few simple ingredients, two plastic bags, and some ice. It’s a great</br> activity for kids, summer parties, or anytime you want a sweet treat in just a few minutes!</p>

         <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup half-and-half (or whole milk)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Ice (enough to fill a gallon-sized bag halfway)</li>
                <li>⅓ cup salt (rock salt or coarse salt works best)</li>
            </ul>

         <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small quart-sized zip-top bag, combine the half-and-half, sugar, and</br> vanilla. Seal tightly, removing as much air as possible.
                <li>Fill a gallon-sized zip-top bag halfway with ice. Add the salt and mix</br> slightly.</li>  
                <li>Place the sealed smaller bag inside the larger bag with ice and salt.</br> Seal the big bag tightly.</li>   
                <li>Shake and knead the bag for about 10-15 minutes, or until the mixture thickens</br>into ice cream. (Use a towel or oven mitts to protect your hands from the cold.)</li>
                <li>Remove the small bag, wipe off any salt from the outside, and scoop the ice</br> cream into a bowl.</li>
            </ol>
            <em><p>Optional: Add mix-ins like chocolate chips, sprinkles, or fruit after shaking.</p></em>
